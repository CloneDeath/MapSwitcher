I didn't make this, but I did put a lot of time into cleaning up the code and building a bridge between v6 and v7.

All of this is untested (I'd rather just wait for the actual release so I can play multiplayer)
I just thought it looked cool, but I've heard from some people that it looks like it's working fine (Setting the AI may not be working?).

I started this because:
	1) People didn't like the Donate button. I removed it for them.
	2) v7 was closed source, and trusted binaries are scary...
so, here you guys go, the source code.

I will not decompile and include the StormLauncher, it's C++. I COULD try to reverse engineer it, but that'd take days, 
and I don't even know if it is built with the same source as the ones he posted previously.

As always, the guy's main thread appears to be here:

P.S. I've tagged the "closest related" version of mine with his.
